My new project, Reviewer #2 should be live!! Check it out at https://jaydahhei.github.io/reviewer2/

This project is just a fun (or not so fun) simulation of Reviewer #2 responding to your abstract that you can submit in the website. 

The first time I put my abstract into the page, I teared up a little bit. Was it from pride of builing my worst enemy? Or from actually being hurt by Reviewer #2's words? Who can say.

Anyway, I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!
